# Instructions to run the all_cells_mask inference generation pipeline
  # Run all_cells_mask model trianing
    # Use the conda environment sandi-cytodl2 on any A100 machines
    # Go to the directory (use 'cd' command) "\\allen\aics\assay-dev\users\Sandi\cyto-dl"
    # To re-run the whole training run --> python cyto_dl/train.py experiment=local/train_cytoGFP_segmentation_model.yaml
  # Run multi-scale patch-based evaluation to generate probability maps
    # ToDo
  # Run thresholding and merging script to generate the all cells mask
    # ToDo
