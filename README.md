# EMT image analysis code

This repository contains code for reproducing the image analysis used in our manuscript. This repository uses public available data hosted on AWS. The segmentations and 3D meshes generated by this code is further used by [EMT_data_analysis](https://github.com/AllenCell/EMT_data_analysis) to make the plots shwon in the manuscript.
