# EMT image analysis code

This repository contains code for reproducing the image analysis used in our manuscript [1]. This repository uses public available data hosted on AWS. The segmentations and 3D meshes generated by this code is further used by [EMT_data_analysis](https://github.com/AllenCell/EMT_data_analysis) to make the plots shwon in the manuscript.
