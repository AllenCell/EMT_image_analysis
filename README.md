# Scope
This repository is published to the public for the purpose of transparency, but it is not maintained to a level where it is easy to re-run the code here. Most of the code has hardcoded paths to the authors' file system, so re-use would require a bit of editing the code. If you would like to re-run or re-use the code here, please reach out to us at cells@alleninstitute.org.
